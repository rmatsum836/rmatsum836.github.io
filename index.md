   <p>I am a chemical engineering Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt
   University working for  <a href="http://huggins.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/ptc/"
   onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://huggins.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/ptc/');">Peter Cummings</a>.  I use molecular dynamics simulations to
   develop predictive models of electrolyte transport for
   energy-storage devices.</p>

   <p>Outside of my research, I'm interested in open-source software
   development and contribute to various projects as much as
   possible.  Additionally, I enjoy learning about data science
   through working on side projects.</p>

   <p>In my free time, I enjoy golfing and watching Clemson
   football. <br style="clear: both;" /></p>
