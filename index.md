   <p>Hello! My name is Ray Matsumoto and I am a 
   chemical engineering Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt
   University working for  <a href="http://huggins.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/ptc/"
   onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://huggins.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/ptc/');">Peter Cummings</a>.  I use molecular dynamics simulations to
   study the structure and transport properties of novel electrolytes
   for energy-storage devices.
   I have gained extensive experience in data 
   analysis/visualization in Python for the numerous research projects 
   I have 
   been involved in.  Additionally, I'm an active developer and 
   contributor for several open-source Python packages.</p>

   <p>Based on my experiences in programming and tackling scientific
   problems, I want to become a data scientist after my Ph.D.
   Most of my learnings in the data science field originate from
   side-projects I work on, which can be viewed at my GitHub profile
   or on my projects page.
   </p>

   <p>In my free time, I enjoy golfing and watching all types of
   sports, especially Clemson 
   football. <br style="clear: both;" /></p>
