      <p>My name is Ray Matsumoto, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in
      chemical engineering at Vanderbilt University.  I work in the
      Cummings Group, and I use molecular dynamics simulations to
      develop predictive models of electrolyte transport for
      energy-storage devices.</p>
