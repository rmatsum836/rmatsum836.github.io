Hi everyone, my name is Ray Matsumoto and this is my first post where
I want to say a little about myself and what I aim to do with this
blog.  I come from an engineering background, graduating from Clemson
University in 2015 with a degree in Materials Science and Engineering.
Since 2016 I have been a member of the Cummings Research Group, using
molecular simulation to study electrolytes and electrodes for the
purpose of improving supercapacitors.

What I enjoy most about my role in grad school is developing software,
building workflows, and analyzing data with Python.  In particular, I
have enjoyed working on data science projects where I get to clean
data, perform feature engineering, and build models.
I plan to continue working on side
projects and learn new concepts so that I can become a data scientist once I graduate
from Vanderbilt.

As a result, I will mostly focus on Python, molecular simulation
techniques, computer science,and data science in
this blog.  I anticipate that much of the content for my posts will 
be concepts and techniques I'm learning at that moment.
Other times I plan to write blog posts on mistakes
I've made and lessons I've learned in molecular simulation, data
science, and software design (Believe me, there are many to talk about).  I hope these posts not only serve as documentation for myself, but that you can learn a thing
or two as well.  Thanks for reading.
